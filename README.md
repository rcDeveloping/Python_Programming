# Python programming
This repository has dedicated to storing scripts used during my Python programming language learning journey. Some examples come from [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [Hashtag Treinamentos](https://www.hashtagtreinamentos.com/) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).
